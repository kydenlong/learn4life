      <h1>Sephiroth</h1>
      <p>This was a project I constructed at Bitwise Industries while attending classes there. It is a short summary of the popular video game character Sephiroth. I used an image of the game character and then took a short bio from the web.</p>

      <h1>Written Iridium</h1>
      <p>This is a continuation of the project Written Iridium. This time I replicated the template wibsite almost to perfection. I used the images used on the website. I also did it using html and css. This project was done during class.</p>

      <h1>Pizza My Heart</h1>
      <p>This was a website replication I did while taking a class at Bitwise Industries. I tried my best to replicate the page exactly according to the standards of the actual website page by Pizza My Heart. I used the images provided to me.</p>

      <h1>Berrock Shop</h1>
      <p>This is a project I constructed using html and css. I replicated a page from another website called Berrock Shop. I used images linked to me by my teacher at Bitwise Industries. I tried my best to make it look exactly alike.</p>

      <h1>Iridium</h1>
      <p>This was a project I constructed using a design example from template and doing a rough replication of that example. I used my own images instead of the images provided by the template. I also used Lorem ipsum to fill in spaces.</p>

        <h1>Full Motion</h1>
        <p>This is a project I constructed as part of a class practice session. The challenge was to align the items in a row using html and css. This project was done before I became acquainted with flex-box. I did this in class.</p>
