      <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>  My name is Kyden Long, and I am a junior developer currently working with amarquez design and doing open source work. I have been active in the web-development industry since age 15, and I am very passionate about the possibilities that web-development has to offer. I am a student at Crescent View West and I am taking courses on web design and developement at Bitwise Industries in downtown Fresno. I am very determined when it comes to my work, and I am a perfectionist. If their is a job to be done or a problem to be fixed, I will jump right in to help. I am dependable and trustworthy. As well as website developement, I also work at iToy Repair as a repair technician. Over all I am excited about the future of the web-development industry and what it holds for aspiring developers like myself. I am always reaching for a challenge but I don't have a problem admitting when something is out of my range of experience. I am a determined, perfectionist junior developer.</p>
