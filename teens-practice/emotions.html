    <p>The emotional life of teenagers can be a very interesting subject. Most of the time teenagers need the approval of those around them to feel confident. Unfortunately such approval is never attained in the amounts it is needed. Because of this most teenagers often feel mixed emotions like confusion, anger, mistrust. These emotions are common in teenagers ,and are felt very strongly in most teens. Depression in teens is very high all around the world, although it is higher in some places than others. People usually don't realize how what they say and do can affect those around them. That being said, a lot of times teenage emotions come from the actions of people around them. Home life, social life, and personal hobbies all play a part in the emotions teenagers most feel. One of the hardest things for teenagers to do is be confident in themselves, but it is key in having a healthy emotional life and healthy control over emotions.
