    <p>Teenagers often face many problems when it comes to interacting with peers and adults. In a person's early childhood years, they are usually very excepting of everything and everyone around them. As people grow older however, they become more sceptical of the information given to them by the people around them. Most teenagers also feel deep senses of depretion as well which hinders their ability to communicate their feelings well with others. This leads to poor commuincation and poor social interaction. Teenagers usually want to either be left completely alone, or they choose to surround themselves with as many distractions as possible so they do not have to focus on their lives and hardships. Socializing for a teenager has a lot to do with acceptance. As children people could care less about what everyone else thought of them. As teens we become greatly more aware of the opinions of those around us. Teenagers feel a constant need for attention, and that usually makes them try their best to fit in even if it means forgoing personal beliefs. This strong desire to fit in with a group is usually referred to as peer pressure, and teens all around the world experience it. When it comes to interacting with teenagers people should try to make them feel accepted regardless of their background, skin color, race, etc.
    Show teenagers that they "fit in" just how they are.
